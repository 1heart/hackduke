          <br>They will be notified by email by <strong>October 19th</strong> about their status and will have until <strong>October 26th</strong> to confirm their spot and whether they need travel reimbursement.
          <br><br>If you did not get an email regarding confirmation of participation, you can opt to be put on the waitlist, so that when we find out that we have room for more participants, we will be selecting from the waitlist.
